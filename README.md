### Overview

This Electron app parses an .srt file and then offers that data up in TSV format, writing the TSV file to your local drive. Great for multimedia teams who need to port subtitles over to spreadsheets in a pinch.

### Prerequisites

- Download the release for your platform

### Running Application

Open the application, select the srt you want processed or drag it into the window. Click 'Save To' to choose where to save the .tsv file on your computer or by default it will save to the home directory of the provided srt. If all went well, the 'Execute' button will flash, and you can click it to create the tsv file.
